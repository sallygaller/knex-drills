# Knex Drills!

With the shopping_list table in place, make a new file inside your knex-practice project, ./src/drills.js. Inside the drills file, connect knex to your knex-practice database and write functions that can perform the following queries:
1. Get all items that contain text
2. Get all items paginated
3. Get all items added after date
4. Get the total cost for each category

Make a new file in your knex-practice project for ./src/shopping-list-service.js that contains methods for CRUD: to get, insert, update and delete shopping list items. Also, make a ./test/shopping-list-service.spec.js file that tests the CRUD methods.
